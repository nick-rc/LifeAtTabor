# LifeAtTabor
A board-game app made for my senior project at Tabor Academy.
Contact nick-rc on GitHub for more info.



# About The Project
This was an app I did in highschool as a Senior Project. It was my first real dive into Objective-C and iOS development and was not made very efficiently. It is my goal to eventually update everything and make it a better functioning app.


# TO-DO List
1.) Reorganize file system within repository
2.) Update LAT Project so it will at least run
3.) Create a new set of images for the project
4.) Update LAT Project to support iOS 8
5.) Update view transitions
6.) Create Sign-In screen.
